# Todo App With React-Redux

This is a todo app that was built while learning to use the state management library of redux. The current functionality consists of Addition of Todos, Toggling between finished Todo and unfinished as well as removing todos. More functionality to come as I dabble as well as actually add some styling.

If you'd like to play around with this simple app just clone the repo and do a `npm install` and `npm start`.
